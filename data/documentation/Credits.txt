:: Project Pokémon Forums: Again for any help they gave in relation to HG/SS problems, either to myself directly or to other people.
:: Alpha and SCV: Though it hasn't been updated in a while, PPRE is the single most important thing needed to create this hack. Very much appreciated.
:: KazoWAR: His tutorial on inserting sprites in HG/SS was important in order to get that Steven sprite in.
:: Dewgong/Frostbite: For the Steven trainer sprite added to the game.
:: Various GBAtemp / YouTube Members: For your continued support and ideas during the production of SG/SS.
:: Jhon 591 of Romulation: For his significantly improved HG/SS anti piracy patch which means you guys can play this game on no$gba WITHOUT it crashing every five seconds!
:: Jensei: For speeding quite fast through the game and informing me of bugs on the initial releases. Can't say it looks good on me, but it helped!
:: Early Players: I can't thank you enough for helping out with all the bugs, and apologies for making you download things so many times!

Tools Used

The main tool used in order to produce this hack was PPRE, with its Pokémon editing, script editing, overworld editing and Trainer editing features. Other tools included the ever trusty crystaltile2, some moments from Cygnus Hex Editor, and the use of programs such as Tile Molester for the one bit of sprite work I did.
