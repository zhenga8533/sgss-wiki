This document exists as a reference guide to the changes made to Pokémon within Sacred Gold and Storm Silver. All changes (bar Evolutions, which have their own document) are listed in here, including changes to abilities, level-up moves, stats, types and others.

Notation is the following…
- () = New
- {} = Replaces Original
- [] = Shifts from Original Position
- * = Level Up Moves Revamped
In an ability context, if {} is used then it refers to which ability has been replaced by the new one, otherwise it's just an addition. For level-up moves, it is explanatory with the prior definitions.

Remember: Use Ctrl+F to find a Pokémon easily! If a Pokémon is missing from the document, then no changes have been applied to it.

Also an important note: the move relearner, together with the move deleter has been moved to the top left house in Cianwood City. There are also some changes to moves:
- Cut is a 60-power Grass move
- Strength is a 60-power Rock move with a 10% chance of reducing the foe's Attack
- Rock Smash is a 60-power Fighting move which now has a 30% chance of reducing Defense.
- All Black and White upgrades to moves have been added where possible, too.
