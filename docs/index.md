!!! note

    This site is fanmade! Much of the data in the Pokemon doc-pages was made by parsing through documents found from the official ROM hacks. Specific Pokémon information was fetched from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/){:target="\_blank"} using a [parser](https://github.com/zhenga8533/pokeapi-parser/){:target="\_blank"}.

!!! warning

    This site is not a viable source for the [Classic](getting_started/patching_guide.md/) version of this rom hack. It is recommended to play the [Full](getting_started/patching_guide.md/) version of either ROM Hack for the full experience!
