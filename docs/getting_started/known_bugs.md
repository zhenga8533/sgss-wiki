A strikeout (example) represents that the bug has been fixed and will be eliminated in the next version release.

- Possible black screen and/or white screens from various events around the Safari Zone area. I'm unsure on the specifics of this one, but save often just in case. This isn't a consistent bug so it's difficult to test and fix.
