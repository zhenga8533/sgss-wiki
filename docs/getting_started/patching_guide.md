## Version Clarification

There are two options for players of Sacred Gold & Storm Silver; the Complete version or the Classic version.

The Complete version includes every single change I have made to the game. It's the same idea as BB/VW's Full version.

The Classic version includes most changes but excludes any changes made directly to Pokémon (stats, types, TM compatibility, level up move changes etc). It's the same idea as BB/VW's Clean version.

The patch includes the anti piracy patch already, so you will need to use a clean Heart Gold or Soul Silver ROM to get these to work. The HGSS rom should be American.

A version of the hack with Fairy-type added made by mikelan98 is also available [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/poqbv8c6azhu1u3/2sg2ss411.zip). This affects any moves that were changed to Fairy-type in Gen 6 and also grants the Fairy typing to relevant Pokémon (e.g. Wigglytuff, Clefable, Gardevoir.)

For the easiest way to patch these, get a HG or SS rom from Emuparadise, then use the xDelta GUI to choose the patch you wish, choose your ROM and a patched version will be generated - this will be Sacred Gold or Storm Silver.

In the event of an update, you must apply the patch to the CLEAN ROM, NOT the already patched ROM.

## Summary

Complete Version - ALL changes that have been made to the game.

Classic Version - ALL changes that have been made to the game excluding edits to Pokémon such as stats, types, level-up moves, abilities etc.

The anti-piracy fix is included with the patch so you will need the clean ROM. The CRCs should be as follows (viewable when opened in a RAR):

Heart Gold: FFD28F00
Soul Silver: EBB387E7

Play the game with no$gba 2.6a (preferably with no$zoomer), DeSmuME or a DS flashcard of your choice. Enjoy!
