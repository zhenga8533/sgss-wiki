For the easiest way to patch these, get a HG or SS rom from Emuparadise, then use the xDelta GUI to choose the patch you wish, choose your ROM and a patched version will be generated - this will be Sacred Gold or Storm Silver.

In the event of an update, you must apply the patch to the CLEAN ROM, NOT the already patched ROM.

To reiterate:

Complete Version - ALL changes that I've made to the game.
Classic Version - ALL changes I've made to the game excluding edits to Pok√©mon such as stats, types, level-up moves, abilities etc.

The anti-piracy fix is included with the patch so you will need the clean ROM. The CRCs should be as follows (viewable when opened in a RAR):

```
Heart Gold: FFD28F00
Soul Silver: EBB387E7
```

Play the game with no$gba 2.6a (preferably with no$zoomer), DeSmuME or a DS flashcard of your choice. Enjoy!
