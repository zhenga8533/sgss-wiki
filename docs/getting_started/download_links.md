The patch includes the anti piracy patch already, so you will need to use a clean Heart Gold or Soul Silver ROM to get these to work. The HGSS rom should be American.

A version of the hack with Fairy-type added made by [mikelan98](https://x.com/mikelan98){:target="\_blank"} is also available [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/poqbv8c6azhu1u3/2sg2ss411.zip){:target="\_blank"}. This affects any moves that were changed to Fairy-type in Gen 6 and also grants the Fairy typing to relevant Pok√©mon (e.g. Wigglytuff, Clefable, Gardevoir.)
