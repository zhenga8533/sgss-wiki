## Contributors

**afcmark15, bossdresser, Joodicator & other friends**

: For contributing ideas to the hack, as well as in some cases helping to playtest the thing (albeit, not much, but it's something!)

**Project Pokémon Forums**

: Again for any help they gave in relation to HG/SS problems, either to Drayano directly or to other people.

**Alpha and SCV**

: Though it hasn't been updated in a while, PPRE is the single most important thing needed to create this hack. Very much appreciated.

**KazoWAR**

: His tutorial on inserting sprites in HG/SS was important in order to get that Steven sprite in.

**Dewgong/Frostbite**

: For the Steven trainer sprite added to the game.

**Various GBAtemp / YouTube Members**

: For your continued support and ideas during the production of SG/SS.

**Jhon 591 of Romulation**

: For his significantly improved HG/SS anti piracy patch which means you guys can play this game on no$gba WITHOUT it crashing every five seconds!

**Jensei**

: For speeding quite fast through the game and informing me of bugs on the initial releases. Can't say it looks good on me, but it helped!

**Early Players**

: Drayano can't thank you enough for helping out with all the bugs, and apologies for making you download things so many times!

## Tools Used

**PPRE**

: For its Pokémon editing, script editing, overworld editing and Trainer editing features.

**crystaltile2 & Cygnus Hex Editor**

: For some help with editing features.

**Tile Molester**

: For the one bit of sprite work Drayano did.
