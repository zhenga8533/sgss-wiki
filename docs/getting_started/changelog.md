## Version 1.0.2

- Problem with some flags fixed that meant events weren't disabled/enabled correctly for certain players. This changes the flag setting to ALWAYS occur, but for people who are ahead, do not wish to restart their save files and are finding themselves unable to get Surf due to a dance theater blockade, download this ## version and head to Olivine Pokemon Center and talk to a woman with blue hair to sort your problems out.

- Additionally some small documentation changes have been added since a couple of items were not listed.
