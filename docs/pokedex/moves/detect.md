If the user successfully used detect, endure, protect, quick guard, or wide guard on the last turn, this move has a 50% chance to fail. lock on, mind reader, and no guard provide a (100 – accuracy)% chance for moves to break through this move. This does not apply to one-hit KO moves (fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold); those are always blocked by this move. thunder during rain dance and blizzard during hail have a 30% chance to break through this move. The following effects are not prevented by this move: * acupressure from an ally * curse’s curse effect * Delayed damage from doom desire and future sight; however, these moves will be prevented if they are used this turn * feint, which will also end this move’s protection after it hits * imprison * perish song * shadow force * Moves that merely copy the user, such as transform or psych up This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.
