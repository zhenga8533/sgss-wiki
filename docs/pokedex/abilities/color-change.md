## :material-information: Effect

!!! info "Full Description"

    Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move. If the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden. The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a substitute will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as spikes. This ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack. In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves.

!!! tip "Quick Summary"

    Changes type to match when hit by a damaging move.

## :material-book-open: In-Game Description

!!! quote "Heart Gold & Soul Silver"

    Changes the Pokémon’s type to the foe’s move.

## :material-pokeball: Pokémon with this Ability

### :material-star: Standard Ability
