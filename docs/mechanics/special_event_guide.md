# Special Event Guide

This document details the legendary encounters in the games as well as a few other one-time encounters such as Rotom and Spiritomb.

The information detailed here is relevant to most of the 'discovering' sections in the game; unless you are positive you want to spoil yourself on how to get some of these rarer Pokémon, move away from this document now.

Note that for newly added event encounters, you have endless opportunities to catch them unless otherwise specified.

## Non-Legendary Encounters

### #479 Rotom

![Rotom](../assets/sprites/rotom/front.gif "Rotom")

1. Obtaining Rotom is fairly simple; once you earn your Plain Badge from Whitney, return to New Bark Town and interact with the TV on the bottom floor of your house
2. You will be asked if you want to thump it, á la Diamond & Pearl; choose Yes to encounter a Level 20 Rotom
3. Note that if you wish to change Rotom's form prior to reaching Saffron City properly, there is a thief in the bottom of the Goldenrod Mart behind a box who will teleport you to the appropriate room.

### #442 Spiritomb

![Spiritomb](../assets/sprites/spiritomb/front.gif "Spiritomb")

**Requirements:**

1. An Odd Keystone

3. You will be asked if you want to throw the keystone into the well; choose Yes to encounter a Level 20 Spiritomb

5. Further Odd Keystones can be obtained from the captain of the S.S
6. Aqua after obtaining the Earth Badge.

**Guide:**

1. Although Phione isn't a legend, I felt I may as well put it here with the others anyway
2. Getting Phione is fairly simple; as the girl at the shore of Route 40 will tell you, schools of Phione cross the seas

### #493 Arceus

![Arceus](../assets/sprites/arceus/front.gif "Arceus")

Capturing Arceus is the main objective of Sacred Gold & Storm Silver, so if you do manage to capture it, you will have officially completed the hack (and there will be text in the game reflecting as such). However, due to this, it's an incredibly tough Pokémon to capture!

**Requirements:**

1. The first requirement is that you must have captured each and every other available Pokémon. That means you will need to obtain 492 different Pokémon species before being allowed to challenge Arceus, and they aren't all wild! You can use features such as the Meridian and Pastoral Sounds and the Game Corner to speed things up, but there will be some Pokémon that you either have to evolve or breed to actually get everything on the list.
1. The second requirement is that you need to obtain all sixteen of the Plate items, which have been dotted around the regions in a sort of Treasure Hunt. The locations for these will be detailed below…

**Guide:**

1. Once both of these requirements have been fulfilled, head to the Mystri Stage
2. Assuming there is nothing else on the stage (which there shouldn't be, given that you need to capture everything to even try Arceus) then walk to the center and a check will be performed; if you have all sixteen Plate items in your inventory and your Pokédex is as full as can be, you will be given one chance to battle Arceus
3. Note that if you run or knock it out, this will be considered as the 'bad ending', and a quick reset will be needed to try again as the credits will automatically play after the game regardless of whether you run from Arceus, knock it out or capture it
4. Capturing Arceus will also lock you out of Sinjoh Ruins, but there's nothing to do afterwards, anyway…

**Plates:**

You will of course need sixteen Plates, one for each non-Normal type. Their locations are generally related to their elements; you might find them on the ground somewhere, or they might have been picked up by someone who doesn't know what they do… at any rate, a list is below if you're truly stuck.

1. Flame Plate: There's a dirt pile in Bellchime Trail hidden between some trees. Check it to obtain the Plate.
1. Splash Plate: In the main room of the S.S. Aqua there is a guy on the left side who wants to see Phione. Show him a Phione and he'll want to see a Manaphy. Show him Manaphy and he'll give you the Splash Plate.
1. Icicle Plate: There is a snow pile somewhat hidden behind a wall in the snowy outside of Sinjoh Ruins. Check it to obtain the Icicle Plate.
1. Toxic Plate: After obtaining the Hive Badge, go to Elm's lab in New Bark Town and interact with the bin. You will find and obtain the Toxic Plate.
1. Mind Plate: Visit Mr. Psychic's house in Saffron City; there is a new character who wishes to see a Psychic Pokémon that has reached stage two (i.e. the final form of a three-stage evolution line). Talk to him with Alakazam, Gardevoir, Gallade or Metagross at the front of your party to receive the Mind Plate.
1. Zap Plate: Once you get the Power Plant up and running again, check the bookcase to the bottom-right of the room to get the Zap Plate.
1. Meadow Plate: On Route 39 there is a girl by some trees having trouble with her dance moves; if you talk to her with a Bellossom behind you, she will ask if you will let it dance for her. Do so and she'll thank you with both a TM53 and the Meadow Plate.
1. Fist Plate: Obtain the Tyrogue from the Karate King in Mt. Mortar; it is equipped with the Fist Plate.
1. Sky Plate: There is a pile of snow directly in front of Red at the top of Mt. Silver; check it to get the Sky Plate.
1. Earth Plate: Return to Diglett's Cave with Rock Climb and check one of the higher areas to find the Earth Plate in an item ball.
1. Insect Plate: In National Park, there is a trainer in the center-north who will say something about the ground beneath him being hard. Interact with the spot he was on when in the Bug Catching Contest and you will obtain the Insect Plate.
1. Stone Plate: To the right of Pewter Museum there should be a pile of dirt; check it to obtain the Stone Plate. (If the pile isn't there for some reason before you obtain the Plate, it's located as far to the bottom-right corner as you can go before jumping over the ledge.)
1. Spooky Plate: In Lavender Town's cemetery there is a woman who asks if you would pay your respects to her Pokémon. Agree to do so and she'll give you the Spooky Plate as thanks.
1. Draco Plate: Obtain the Dragonair from the Dragon's Den Elder. It is equipped with the Draco Plate.
1. Dread Plate: In Olivine Lighthouse there is a woman who asks for 15 Poké Balls and a Destiny Knot; the Destiny Knot is obtainable in an item ball on Route 27. If you talk to her with both and agree to your request, she'll fail to make an item and run off. You don't get your given items back, but she does drop the Dread Plate behind her.
1. Iron Plate: Steven will give you this one automatically when he explains the Plates inthe gatehouse between Ecruteak City and Route 38.

---

## Final Notes

Good luck with your legendary hunting!

N.B.: The original design for the Mind Plate was as a reward for capturing all 28 forms of Unown, but this got changed due to it being a bit too tedious to be worthwhile. Consider yourselves lucky!
