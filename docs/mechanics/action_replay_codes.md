# Action Replay Codes

!!! warning

    This document serves as a reference guide to some useful codes for Sacred Gold and Storm Silver designed for ease of gameplay. These are not intended to make the game easier!

All codes for the American Heart Gold & Soul Silver will work for Sacred Gold & Storm Silver; codes listed in here are simply my personal recommendations. However, the Game IDs for SG/SS are different, which will affect those of you playing on flashcarts.

The new IDs are as follows:

```
Sacred Gold - Complete: IPKE 66972395
Storm Silver - Complete: IPGE D5D82CBF
Sacred Gold - Classic: IPKE 7BAC813A
Storm Silver - Classic: IPGE C794B178
```

## Instant Message Code

This is a personal favourite of mine. This will make all messages appear instantly rather than waiting for scrolling text. Note that when using this code with DeSmuME, you will need to disable it when booting up/restarting the game or it will stick in place.

```
12002346 00002100
120202EE 00001C0C
120202F0 00004818
1202031E 0000BD10
02020320 E7E53C2D
1202032E 0000D0DF
1202033A 0000E7F1
```

## Quick Screen Change

This is a code that will speed up the transition between buildings. Use if you really want to boost your time.

```

1200FA9C 00002200
```

## Pokémon Center Animation Cut

This is a useful code if you want to speed things up. It will cause your Trainer to hand their Pokémon to the nurse and then get them handed straight back with no intermediate animation.

```
1206325E 0000E000
1206327A 0000E000
9224BDCC 00002000
1224BDCC 00002001
D2000000 00000000
```

## Gauge Bar Animation Cut

A code useful to counter the slow moving HP bars of the fourth generation; after Pokémon have a sufficiently high amount of max HP, instead of a scrolling animation the HP bar will simply cut straight to the point it will end up at. This also affects the EXP bar. Note that some sound effects may be cut out as a result.

```
12265A80 00001C20
12265A8E 00001C20
12081750 00001C21

## High Speed Processing

This is an interesting code that will speed up the rate of things in the game; this is particularly useful on flashcarts as it will make battles go that much faster, kind of giving an emulation-like experience.

```
12000104 00000000
B21D1594 00000000
DA000000 00000004
D3000000 00000000
D6000000 02000100
D3000000 00000000
92000100 00001C1C
12000E1E 000046F0
12000E20 000046F0
12000104 00008080
D2000000 00000000
92000100 0000071C
12000E1E 000046C0
12000E20 000046C0
12000104 00008080
D2000000 00000000
A2000104 00008080
12000E1E 0000F0D0
12000E20 0000E826
D2000000 00000000
```

## HM Animation Cut

This will cut out a large amount of the animation for HMs, making it a lot quicker to move around when you have to use them.

```

## Disable 3D Edge Marking

This code will tidy things up if you're playing the game on NO$GBA. It's totally useless on anything else that renders the graphics correctly (e.g. DeSmuME, flashcards…)

```
521FBC38 20204001
221FBC3A 00000010
D2000000 00000000
```

## Rematch Trainers

This code might help if you’re feeling a bit low on experience. Talk to any generic trainer while holding the R button to rematch them. All codes with thanks to the guys over at cheats.gbatemp.
